To install, go to https://replit.com, and search for "Ultraviolt", and fork one of the many repls. Then start the repl.
After this, highlight this code and drag to bookmarks, and replace 'YOUR LINK HERE' with the repl site link.
javascript: var win = window.open(); var url = 'YOUR LINK HERE'; var iframe = win.document.createElement(%27iframe%27); iframe.style="position:fixed;width:100vw;height:100vh;top:0px;left:0px;right:0px;bottom:0px;z-index:2147483647;background-color:white;border:none;"; iframe.src = url; win.document.body.appendChild(iframe);
Now you can open Ultraviolet from javascript supported sites.
